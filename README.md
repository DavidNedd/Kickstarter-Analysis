Summary

This project shows my ability to read/manipulate date in excel, and create an analysis based off of my work

Files present analysis of Kickstarter data using Excel and Word
Files

The Report.docx file is a Word Document going over key points from the analysis.  
The Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx file is an Excel File which includes the Kickstarter data as well as the graphing and tabular analysis

Based on launch data we are able to determine that May is the most succesful launch month for companies, with September-October being the least succesful months.  

The data produced from the excel sheet can give us a plethora of info to bring us to a few different conclusions.  For example, although the Music category proved to be most successful, having a success rate of 77%, they also had the lowest average funding of any other genre.  Additionally, although Theater is the largest market on the site which experiences its peak season between May and July if we were to omit this data point, January would have the highest number of new campaigns.    


	Evidence points towards this dataset being somewhat incomplete, Kickstarter campaigns are often unsuccessful with 2/3 of campaigns being unsuccessful.  Our data however shows that around half of projects are unsuccessful implying that we started with an incomplete dataset to begin with.  On the Kickstarter website they have no indication that theater is their largest campaign genre, further proving the point that our data set isnâ€™t complete.  


	Lastly, although we took advantage of pivot tables, we could have used graphs for all of the metrics covering the plays category.  Tables would have been a great tool to help visualize the most successful genres vs most unsuccessful, as well as success rate, average donation, category, length of campaign and outcomes.  In conclusion, excel enables us to better read the data analyzed which unfortunately gives us only half of the story in regard to Kickstarter campaigns and how they work.
